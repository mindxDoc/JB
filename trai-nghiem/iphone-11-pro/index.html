    <h1>And then there was Pro.</h1>
    <p>A transformative triple‑camera system that adds tons of capability without complexity. An unprecedented leap in battery life. And a mind‑blowing chip that doubles down on machine learning and pushes the boundaries of what a smartphone can do. Welcome to the first iPhone powerful enough to be called Pro.</p>

    <h1>Pro performance</h1>
    <h1>A chip so advanced, even we’re trying to catch up.</h1>
    <p>We custom‑built A13 Bionic with a focus on machine learning across the entire chip — enabling experiences that simply aren’t found on any other smartphone. In fact, it’s so fast, so powerful, and so intelligent, it’s years ahead of any other chip. Which gives you an unfair advantage.</p>
